Everybody knows that [dokku](https://github.com/dokku/dokku) is the best thing ever
when it comes to deploying web applications. Unfortunately, though, the best thing's
Let's Encrypt plugin [dokku-letsencrypt](https://github.com/dokku/dokku-letsencrypt)
does not support wildcard certificates.

This is how to succeed when faced with such challenge.

## dokku certs inner workings

Dokku stores everything around the deployment of an app in a aptly named directory
inside `/home/dokku`. It also stores the certificates there, which are referenced
from the app's nginx.conf.

An app's nginx.conf is customizable via the sigil template dokku uses.

Assuming we get a wildcard certificate, one way to install it would be to copy the cert
files there and let the templated nginx config find it. This path would also require to
change the `DOKKU_PROXY_PORT_MAP` and `DOKKU_PROXY_SSL_PORT` environment variables to
include the 443 port mapping so that the template understand that certificates exist
and accept request at 443.

But there is a better way, by using the `dokku certs` command.

## Getting the wildcard cert

First we need to get our wildcard cert manually. [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) supports wildcard
certficates with this command:

```
certbot certonly --manual
```

When asked for the domain, enter both the bare root domain and the wildcard one.
I.e. `example.com, *.example.com`. Dokku's wish is to have one cert/key pair per app
and we must respect it.

The command asks for both DNS and HTTP challenges. TXT record on a subdomain and a
88-character string served on a `/.well-known/acme-challenge` path.

After following all the steps methodically, it generates the cert and the private
key at: `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<you-domain>/fullchain.pem`.

## Installing the cert into dokku

[Dokku states](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku~v0.20.4/configuration/ssl/#certificate-setting)
it is intelligent enough to understand which is which even when they are not named
`server.key` and `server.crt`. Yet I still renamed them in my adventure â€” not that I don't
trust software. Then tar'ed them as per dokku's desire with:

```sh
tar cvf certs.tar server.key server.crt
```

The actual installation process was much less complicated than expected:

```sh
dokku certs:add mataroa < certs.tar
```

And that's it. [mataroa.blog](https://mataroa.blog/) was wildcardly certificated.
