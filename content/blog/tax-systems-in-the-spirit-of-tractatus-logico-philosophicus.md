In the spirit of [Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus), and assuming we axiomatize the definitions of: `person`, `ability`, `quality`, `material`, `authority`, `state`, `government`, `wealth`, we can argue the following.

1. People want to live with people.<br>
1.1. When people live with people they form societies.<br>
1.2. When people form societies, they want to prosper in economic, intellectual, emotional, creative (ECIE) ways.<br>
1.21. When people form societies, they want authoritative equality.<br>
1.3. Not all people have the same quality of abilities.<br>
1.4. People want for all people to achieve ECIE prosperity.<br>
1.5. For people to achieve ECIE prosperity, they need to have high quality of abilities.<br>
1.5. Not all people have high quality of abilities.<br>
1.6. Not all people can achieve ECIE prosperity.<br>
1.7. People want to help people who cannot achieve ECIE prosperity by themselves, achieve ECIE prosperity.<br>
2. People are fond of materials.<br>
2.1. Societies need a system for materials.<br>
2.2. Earth's societies' materials system is capitalism.<br>
2.21. In capitalism, state governments and high wealth bodies have authority.<br>
2.22. In capitalism, higher wealth means higher authority.<br>
2.3. State governments act with the intent of equality in societies.<br>
2.4. State governments act with the intent of wealth redistribution in societies.<br>
2.5. Tax systems redistribute wealth.<br>
2.51. Wealth redistribution is a method for attaining change in the economic balance of societies.<br>
2.6. Taxes are defined as a percentage of bodies' wealth that is being allocated for redistribution.<br>
2.61. State governments are in charge of defining societies' tax percentage.<br>
2.62. State governments are in charge of collecting societies' tax percentage.<br>
2.63. State governments are in charge of redistributing societies' tax.<br>
2.7. Higher tax percentages mean higher wealth redistribution.<br>
2.71. Higher wealth redistribution means higher ability for change in the economic balance of societies.<br>
2.72. Higher ability for change in the economic balance of societies means higher ability for change in the authoritative balance of societies.<br>
2.8. Higher tax percentages are more beneficial for societies towards ECIE prosperity.<br>
2.9. Higher tax percentages are more beneficial for societies towards authoritative equality.<br>
3. People want tax systems.<br>
3.1. People want higher tax percentages in tax systems.<br>
